The ability to acquire skills rapidly and effortlessly while retaining those already mastered is essential
for robots. However, current methods still rely on a cumbersome training-time loop that is costly
and slow, while eroding skills already mastered. In this paper, we introduce HOST (Human-to-robot
One-Shot Skill AcquisiTion), a framework that enables a robot to acquire skills in seconds from a single
human video while retaining previously mastered skills. HOST resolves skill acquisition through a
cascade of self-grounded prediction. It first estimates the robot’s progress within the demonstrated
task, then translates the upcoming progression into the robot’s own future observations, and finally
derives actions from these predicted observations. This cascade is trained on targets coupled to the
video demonstration, obtained by mapping the robot trajectory and the video demonstration onto a
shared task progress manifold, then redefining each target to align with the future progression of the
video. HOST thereby enables the robot to actively follow the demonstrated procedure and adapt it to
the robot’s embodiment. HOST acquires novel skills at inference time from a single human video in
an average of 29 seconds and achieves a 62% average success rate. It exceeds the zero-shot baseline
by 45% while retaining previously mastered skills. HOST even exceeds the baseline fine-tuned on 50
robot demonstrations per task while requiring 50 times fewer demonstrations and acquiring each skill
507 times faster. Additional information is available on the project website and GitHub repository.

## sec:introduction Introduction
_Pages 1-2_

Developing robots that operate seamlessly in human environments, with varied objects, and utilizing various
skills to complete a broad range of tasks has been a long-standing goal in robotics. In such settings, manipulation
tasks vary widely across objects, tools, procedures, and user preferences, making it infeasible to anticipate
every situation a robot may encounter. A robot may be asked to carry out an unfamiliar household routine,
adapt to a new object arrangement, or handle a tool it has never seen. The ability to acquire new skills rapidly
and effortlessly while retaining those already mastered is therefore essential for robots.
Despite substantial progress in robot learning, teaching a robot each new skill still relies on a cumbersome
training-time loop, a process that is costly, slow, and self-defeating. Reinforcement learning usually requires
task-specific rewards and extensive trial-and-error interaction. On physical robots, such rewards are difficult
to design and often unknown, while interaction remains slow, sample-inefficient and hard to scale across
tasks (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11). Moreover, optimizing the reward for each skill tends to degrade skills the
robot has already mastered. Imitation learning offers a more intuitive and scalable alternative, enabling robots
to acquire skills directly from robot demonstrations (12, 13, 14, 15, 16). Trained on large-scale demonstration
corpora that span hundreds of tasks and diverse embodiments (17, 18, 19, 13, 20, 14, 15, 21), imitation
learning has markedly advanced manipulation generalization. However, the acquisition of a novel skill still
relies on a training-time loop of collection and fine-tuning (22, 23) that exacts a considerable price and
risks eroding skills already mastered. This loop begins with a skilled operator collecting a dedicated batch
of task-specific demonstrations by teleoperating the physical robot, a slow, repeated process that consumes
expert labor and scarce robot time. It then demands offline fine-tuning that incorporates these demonstrations
into the policy, consumes additional compute, and extends over hours before a new skill becomes available.
Even when this price is paid, the gain does not endure. Fine-tuning overwrites parameters shared across

Fig. 1 Robots acquire manipulation skills in seconds from a single human video. (A) Current methods teach a
robot new skills through a cumbersome training-time loop that is costly and slow, and erodes previously mastered skills.
HOST instead acquires skills at inference time, each from a single human video, averaging 29 seconds, while retaining
its previously mastered skills. (B) Skill acquisition from a single human video confronts a structural mismatch between
video demonstration and execution. Temporal asynchrony between the two decouples the prediction target from the video
demonstration, while state discrepancies hinder the translation of the observed behavior into action. (C) HOST overcomes
this mismatch through two mechanisms, coupling prediction targets to the demonstration and resolving execution through
self-grounded prediction, enabling the robot to actively follow the demonstrated procedure and adapt it to the robot’s own
embodiment.
skills, causing each newly acquired behavior to erode previously mastered skills (24, 25). This training-time
loop therefore constitutes the central bottleneck for robots to acquire new skills rapidly and effortlessly while
retaining those already mastered, severely hindering the deployment of robots that operate seamlessly in
human environments, as depicted in Fig. 1A.
We draw inspiration from the observational learning capabilities of humans to break through this bottleneck.
When faced with an unfamiliar task, humans do not require prolonged physical rehearsal or exhaustive trial and
error. Instead, they rapidly acquire new skills by observing others and adapting the observed actions to their
own bodies. Motivated by this cognitive efficiency, we reformulate novel skill acquisition as an inference-time
process rather than a training-time loop, in which the behaviour is specified by a single human video and
translated into robot actions at inference time without task-specific parameter updates. This reformulation
supplies each new skill through a single video in place of the demonstration corpora that fine-tuning requires,
yielding a pronounced improvement in data efficiency. The skill acquisition process proceeds without offline
fine-tuning, enabling a new skill to become available in the time it takes to record it rather than the hours that
teleoperation and offline fine-tuning would otherwise demand. Furthermore, the policy parameters remain
frozen throughout the skill acquisition process, keeping previously mastered skills intact.
As early as 1994, Kuniyoshi et al. (26) envisioned robots that acquire manipulation skills by visually observing
a single human video, a setting later studied as one-shot visual imitation (OSVI). Although this vision has
motivated a long line of work (27, 28, 29, 30, 31), achieving it remains an open challenge. Current prevalent
paradigms (27, 28, 29, 30, 31) straightforwardly extend the imitation learning framework by conditioning
on the video demonstration, while still constructing a direct mapping to robot actions and anchoring each
prediction target to a fixed temporal offset along the execution trajectory. These methods inevitably reduce video
demonstrations to passive context and struggle to translate the observed procedure into precise fine-grained
actions, resulting in performance substantially inferior to that attained with task-specific fine-tuning.
These persistent limitations point to a fundamental problem rooted in the structural mismatch between
video demonstration and execution, illustrated in Fig. 1B. (1) Temporal misalignment relegates the video
demonstration to a passive context. Video demonstrations and robot trajectories are temporally asynchronous,
unfolding at disparate speeds. This decouples the prediction target from the video demonstration context,
relegating the video demonstration to a passive context and hindering the model from acquiring novel skills
from the video demonstration at inference time. (2) State discrepancies between the video demonstration
and robot execution hinder translation into actions. The full video demonstration is provided as a monolithic
input, flooding the model with states irrelevant to its current stage. Even at corresponding segments, substantial
differences in embodiment, viewpoint, and appearance between the video demonstration and the robot
trajectory introduce severe state discrepancies. These hinder direct regression from high-dimensional video
demonstrations to low-dimensional robot actions. (3) Scarce paired supervision impedes the development
of reliable skill acquisition.
Learning to acquire skills from human video for robot execution requires paired data that capture the same
behavior in both human and robot demonstrations. Human videos and robot trajectories are each abundant on
their own, but data pairing the two for the same behavior remains rare. This scarcity impedes the development
of reliable skill acquisition from a single human video.
In this paper, we introduce HOST (Human-to-robot One-Shot Skill AcquisiTion), a framework for acquiring
manipulation skills from a single human video demonstration, illustrated in Fig. 2. The central idea is to treat
skill acquisition not as a passive, direct mapping from a human demonstration to robot action but as a process
driven by the video demonstration and resolved through self-grounded prediction. This formulation builds on
the following two principles.
First, the video demonstration should actively determine the robot’s prediction target. Rather than fixing this
target at a fixed temporal offset along the execution trajectory, independent of the video demonstration, we
couple the target to the upcoming progression of the video demonstration, as shown in Fig. 2A. This coupling is
established by mapping the robot trajectory and the video demonstration onto a shared task progress manifold.
Each target is then redefined to align with the future progression of the video, turning the video from a passive
conditioning signal into the active driver of the robot’s prediction.

Fig. 2 Method overview of HOST. (A) Coupling prediction targets to the demonstration. HOST maps the robot trajectory
and the video demonstration onto a shared task progress manifold, then redefines each target to align with the video’s
future progression, turning the video into the active driver of the robot’s prediction. (B) Resolving execution through
self-grounded prediction. HOST works through a causal cascade of self-grounded stages. It first localizes the robot’s
progress within the video demonstration, then translates its upcoming progression into the robot’s own future observations,
and finally derives actions from these predicted observations. (C) Given a single human video of a previously unseen
task, HOST runs the same self-grounded cascade to carry out the task, acquiring the skill while retaining those already
mastered.
Second, skill acquisition should be resolved through a cascade of self-grounded prediction. Humans do not
acquire skills from a video demonstration in a single step but instead work through a cascade of self-grounded
stages. They first retrieve the task-relevant segment of the video demonstration (32, 33, 34), then internally
simulate the intended movement (35, 36), and finally translate that simulation into action (37, 38). As
illustrated in Fig. 2B, HOST formulates this cascade across three stages. It first localizes where the robot
currently stands within the demonstrated procedure, retrieving the task-relevant segment. It then translates
the upcoming progression of the video demonstration into the robot’s own future observations, and finally
derives actions from these predicted observations. This causal cascade bridges the gap between human video
demonstration and robot action, narrowing the cross-domain discrepancy before action generation.
HOST is trained in two stages to reduce its reliance on human–robot paired data. It is first trained on same-
embodiment paired data, obtained by readily pairing different robot episodes of the same task from existing
datasets. In this stage, the model develops the capacity to follow a demonstrated procedure by predicting
future robot observations and actions conditioned on another execution of the same task. It is then adapted
using a comparatively small set of human–robot paired demonstrations, extending the learned capabilities to
human video demonstrations and enabling reliable skill acquisition from a single human video.
Building on the above analysis, we instantiate HOST, as illustrated in Fig. 2. HOST is trained on same-task
pairs of video demonstrations and robot trajectories, and it then acquires novel skills at inference from a single
human video. During training, each prediction target is coupled to the video demonstration, driving the robot
to actively follow the demonstrated procedure. The model learns to produce this target through a cascade of
self-grounded prediction, adapting the demonstrated procedure to the robot’s own embodiment. It is trained
in two stages, first on same-embodiment robot–robot pairs, then adapted to human-to-robot scenarios with a
small set of human–robot pairs. After training, HOST is able to acquire novel skills by running the self-grounded
cascade conditioned on a single human video, without any parameter update. This video can then be stored
and retrieved without repeated human involvement, enabling the acquired skill to persist across recurring
tasks. Each acquisition takes 29 seconds on average, and HOST reaches 62% average success, exceeding the
strongest one-shot visual imitation baseline by 43% and the strongest zero-shot imitation learning baseline
by 45%. Even compared with the strongest baseline fine-tuned on 50 robot demonstrations per task, HOST
achieves superior performance while using 50 times fewer demonstrations, acquiring new skills 507 times
faster, and retaining previously mastered skills.

2.1
Overview
HOST acquires manipulation skills from a single human video, illustrated in Fig. 3A. Given the human
video shown in the top row, across four representative tasks spanning varied objects, tools and manipulation
primitives, HOST actively follows the demonstrated procedure and adapts it to its own embodiment, carrying
out each task in the bottom row from that single recording without any parameter update.
We benchmark HOST against the strongest baselines in terms of performance on novel tasks, data efficiency,
time efficiency, and retention of previously mastered skills, as reported in Fig. 3B. HOST reaches 62% success
on novel tasks from a single human video, exceeding the strongest baseline without parameter updates by
43%, and surpasses the strongest fine-tuned baseline while using 50 times fewer demonstrations and acquiring
each new skill 507 times faster. This advantage does not come at the cost of previously mastered skills. HOST
retains its original performance, whereas the strongest fine-tuned baseline falls to 43%. The following sections
examine each of these advantages in turn.
We first describe the experimental setup and baselines (Sec. 2.2), then demonstrate that HOST acquires
skills from a single human video across 50 novel manipulation tasks (Sec. 2.3), and next compare HOST
against imitation learning and OSVI baselines on novel tasks without parameter updates (Sec. 2.4). A further
comparison against imitation learning under supervised fine-tuning measures the data and time efficiency of
HOST (Sec. 2.5), and confirms that HOST retains previously mastered skills where fine-tuning erodes them
(Sec. 2.6). We also assess robustness under deployment variations (Sec. 2.7), then measure the contribution
of target coupling (Sec. 2.8) and the self-grounded prediction (Sec. 2.9), and quantify the effect of same-
embodiment pretraining data volume on skill acquisition from a single human video (Sec. 2.10). Finally, we
verify that acquired skills persist across recurring tasks, retrieved from their stored video demonstrations
without repeated human involvement (Sec. 2.11).

the strongest baseline without parameter updates on novel tasks by 43%, surpasses the strongest fine-tuned baseline
while using 50 times fewer demonstrations and acquiring each new skill 507 times faster, and retains its performance on

2.2
Experimental Setup and Baselines
Experimental setup. All experiments are conducted on a bimanual manipulation platform consisting of two
ARX R5 six-axis robotic arms, each equipped with a parallel-jaw gripper. Three RGB cameras observe the
workspace, with one wrist-mounted on each arm and one providing a static third-person view. Each arm
operates in a 10-dimensional action space comprising Cartesian position, a 6D rotation representation, and
gripper aperture, yielding a 20-dimensional bimanual action space. Complete implementation details are
provided in Supplementary Sec. B.
We evaluate skill acquisition on novel tasks that require manipulation skills absent from the training data,
and assess skill retention on previously mastered tasks drawn from the training set. Each task undergoes 20
trials with randomized initial object positions and orientations, and human evaluators judge success against
task-specific completion criteria.
Baselines. We compare HOST against baselines from two paradigms. (1) OSVI methods, namely Vid2Robot (30)
and AWDA (39), are evaluated with their conditioning mechanisms integrated into the HOST backbone to
ensure a fair comparison. As Vid2Robot is not open source, we report results from our reimplementation.
These methods receive a single human video demonstration at test time. (2) Imitation learning methods,
namely 𝜋0.5 (15), Wall-OSS (40), and HOST-base (41), receive a language instruction at test time. HOST-base

shares the HOST backbone but omits target coupling and self-grounded prediction, conditioning directly on
language.
HOST and the OSVI methods follow the same two-stage training protocol described in Sec. 4.4, in which
Stage 1 pretrains on same-embodiment robot–robot pairs formed from 193,462 robot trajectories spanning
229 tasks and Stage 2 adapts the model with human–robot pairs formed from an additional 5,847 self-collected
human video demonstrations, each paired with robot trajectories of the same task drawn from that corpus.
Among the imitation learning methods, 𝜋0.5 and Wall-OSS are initialized from weights pretrained on their
respective large-scale corpora and then trained on the same 193,462 robot trajectories, whereas HOST-base is
trained directly on these robot trajectories.

Fig. 5 Success rates on novel manipulation tasks. HOST acquires each skill from a single human video without any
parameter update across novel tasks whose manipulation skills are absent from the training data, each evaluated over
20 trials. HOST is compared against OSVI baselines (Vid2Robot, AWDA) and language-conditioned imitation learning
baselines (𝜋0.5, Wall-OSS, HOST-base) evaluated zero-shot from the instruction, exceeding the strongest baseline average
by 43%, with the best result per task marked in bold.
2.3
Skill Acquisition across 50 Novel Manipulation Tasks
We evaluate HOST on 50 novel manipulation tasks spanning varied objects, tools, and manipulation primitives.
Each task is evaluated over 20 trials, as reported in Fig. 4. HOST acquires an executable skill on every one of
these 50 tasks from only a single human video per task, without any parameter update, and sustains success
across the full set. This breadth confirms that HOST acquires skills from a single human video broadly across
manipulation tasks. Building on this breadth, we next compare HOST against imitation learning and OSVI
baselines on a subset of these tasks in Sec. 2.4.
2.4
Comparison with Baselines on Novel Tasks
We compare HOST against OSVI and language-conditioned imitation learning baselines on novel tasks whose
manipulation skills are absent from the training data, with all methods evaluated without any parameter
update. HOST acquires the new skill from a single human video and attains the highest average success rate
among all compared methods, as reported in Fig. 5. HOST surpasses the strongest language-conditioned
imitation learning baselines, 𝜋0.5 and Wall-OSS, evaluated zero-shot from the instruction, by 45%, despite
both being pretrained on large-scale corpora. HOST exceeds the strongest OSVI baseline by 43% even though
both methods receive the same single human video, indicating that its advantage comes not from access to
a video demonstration but from how that video demonstration is used to drive execution, through the two
mechanisms that distinguish HOST, coupling prediction targets to the demonstration and resolving execution
through self-grounded prediction, which together carry the demonstrated skill across the gap between human
video and robot execution.
2.5
Data and Time Efficiency of Skill Acquisition
Sec. 2.4 establishes that HOST exceeds the strongest baseline by 43% on novel tasks. We further evaluate
HOST against imitation learning under supervised fine-tuning, the prevalent approach for teaching robots
new skills, measuring the data and time efficiency of HOST relative to it, as reported in Fig. 6.
Data efficiency. We fine-tuned each imitation learning baseline on 10, 20, and 50 teleoperated demonstrations
per novel task using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) (42). We then compared the resulting success rates with
the performance of HOST from a single human video, as presented in Fig. 6A. Performance improved with
the demonstration budget, but even the strongest fine-tuned baseline, Wall-OSS+SFT, reached only 56%
at 50 demonstrations per task, still 6% below the 62% HOST reaches from a single video, while 𝜋0.5+SFT
and HOST-base+SFT remained further below. From a single human video, HOST therefore exceeds the
performance of the strongest baseline at 50 demonstrations. The per-task comparison in Fig. 6C confirms that
this advantage holds across most of these tasks.
Time efficiency. HOST and the imitation learning baselines under supervised fine-tuning differ sharply in
the time required to acquire each new skill. The cost of supervised fine-tuning is dominated by teleoperated
collection of a demonstration corpus and offline fine-tuning, together taking approximately 4.0 to 4.9 hours
per task at 50 demonstrations, as shown in Fig. 6A and broken down in Fig. 6B. HOST, by contrast, reduces this
collection to a single human video recording and removes offline fine-tuning entirely, making each skill available
as soon as the video is recorded. HOST compresses the time it takes to acquire each skill to approximately 29
seconds on average, 507 times faster than even the fastest SFT baseline, 𝜋0.5+SFT, which requires 4.0 hours.
The per-task comparison in Fig. 6C confirms this gap holds consistently across individual tasks.
2.6
Retention of Previously Mastered Skills
We further verify that HOST acquires a new skill without eroding those already mastered, using the seven
previously mastered tasks drawn from the training set and illustrated in Fig. 7B. For each method, we measured
the success rate on these tasks before and after adapting to a novel task, as reported in Fig. 7A. Before adaptation,
HOST and the imitation learning baselines achieve comparable success rates on these tasks. HOST attains the
highest average from only a single video demonstration, as revealed in Fig. 7A and B. All three SFT baselines
decline substantially from this comparable starting success rate after adaptation, with 𝜋0.5+SFT retaining
just 20% of its original performance at 50 demonstrations per task, HOST-base+SFT retaining 22%, and
Wall-OSS+SFT retaining 43%, the highest retention among the three. HOST, by contrast, acquires each new
skill from the video without updating any parameters and retains that success rate afterward, with only a
small residual difference arising from ordinary trial-to-trial variation. HOST exceeds even the SFT baseline
with the highest retention by 56%. HOST thus retains previously mastered skills where fine-tuning erodes
them.
2.7
Robustness under Deployment Perturbations
We evaluate the robustness of HOST to four perturbations that increase the gap between the deployment
environment and the video demonstration. Three perturbations alter the deployment environment, shifting
lighting and color, substituting out-of-distribution objects, or replacing the scene. The fourth disrupts execution
directly, with a person physically displacing an object while the robot is executing the task. HOST retains
Fig. 6 HOST surpasses supervised fine-tuning in success rate, data efficiency and time efficiency. (A) Success rates

against the success rate and acquisition time of HOST from a single human video. (B) Qualitative illustration depicting the
composition of the time to acquire each skill for 𝜋0.5+SFT as a representative baseline, split between data collection and

a single human video. (C) Per-task success rates and the time to acquire each skill for each SFT baseline trained on 50

the great majority of its default success rate of 62% under all four conditions, as reported in Fig. 8. The
performance loss increases with the severity of the perturbation, from 1% under lighting shifts to 4% under
object substitution, 6% under scene replacement, and 9% under human disturbance during execution. Unlike
the other three perturbations, the human disturbance occurs during execution itself, requiring HOST to
autonomously correct its course in response to an unexpected change. The per-task breakdown confirms that
this resilience is broadly distributed. This robustness demonstrates that HOST accurately localizes the current
stage of robot execution within the video demonstration even when a human disturbance during execution
shifts its task progress, and translates the upcoming progression of the video demonstration into corresponding
robot behavior despite the state discrepancies introduced by changes in objects, scene, and lighting.

Fig. 8 HOST remains robust to deployment perturbations. HOST maintains strong performance under lighting variation,
out-of-distribution objects, scene replacement, and human disturbance during execution, illustrated alongside the resulting
average and per-task success rates on novel tasks under each condition.
2.8
Coupling Prediction Targets to the Demonstration
HOST couples each prediction target to the video demonstration, so that each target segment of the robot
trajectory corresponds to the future evolution of the video demonstration. Fig. 9 visualizes the alignment
between the video demonstration and the robot trajectory, validates it against human annotations, and
quantifies the contribution of each coupling ingredient to performance on novel tasks, the same held-out tasks
evaluated in Fig. 5.
Progress alignment and target coupling. Coupling each prediction target to the video demonstration
requires establishing frame-level correspondence between the robot trajectory and the video demonstration.
One direct approach, correspondence based on clock time, matches frames by their relative position in
time. HOST instead aligns frames by task progress on a shared manifold, learned self-supervised without
frame-level annotation. Fig. 9A indicates that this progress alignment recovers frame-level correspondence
between the video demonstration and the robot trajectory, whereas correspondence based on clock time
yields frames from mismatched task stages. Fig. 9B demonstrates that HOST couples each prediction target
to the upcoming progression of the video demonstration using this correspondence. Fig. 9C reveals that
the frame indices recovered by progress alignment scatter around but not on the identity diagonal across
paired training trajectories, confirming that correspondence based on clock time is structurally insufficient.
Fig. 9D establishes that correspondence based on clock time yields a mean absolute progress difference of
0.079 ± 0.062 from human-annotated reference points, compared with 0.006 ± 0.008 for progress alignment.
This order-of-magnitude improvement confirms the reliability of the self-supervised alignment module.
Ablation of coupling variants. Fig. 9E ablates each coupling ingredient in turn, isolating its contribution
to performance on novel tasks. Conditioning the model on the entire video demonstration reaches 0.21.
Restricting the model to a video demonstration window chosen by timestamp raises this to 0.29, a modest
gain limited by the temporal asynchrony between the video demonstration and the robot trajectory, which

often causes a timestamp-matched window to reflect a stage that the robot has not reached. Selecting the
window by task progress on a shared manifold instead raises performance to 0.45, supplying the segment
that matches the current execution stage. Coupling the prediction target to the future evolution of the video
demonstration rather than to a fixed temporal offset along the execution trajectory further raises performance
to 0.62, recovering the full model, with each ingredient in the coupling mechanism proving necessary for
performance on novel tasks.
2.9
Resolving Execution through Self-Grounded Prediction
HOST resolves execution through self-grounded prediction, a causal cascade within a single autoregressive
model that first localizes the robot’s current stage within the video demonstration, then translates its upcoming
progression into the robot’s own future observations, and finally derives actions from these predicted observa-
tions. We quantify the contribution of each stage by introducing it in turn to a baseline that predicts action
directly, as reported in Fig. 10A, with novel tasks drawn from Fig. 5. We then evaluate the accuracy of the
localization stage and the quality of the predicted future observations that the cascade depends on, reported
respectively in Fig. 10B and C.
Ablation of self-grounded prediction. Fig. 10A ablates each stage of self-grounded prediction in turn, isolating
its contribution to performance on novel tasks. A baseline that maps the video demonstration directly to robot
actions, without any intermediate stage, reaches 0.34. This baseline retains coupling prediction targets to the
demonstration, with self-grounded prediction therefore building further gains on top of target coupling. A
localization stage raises success on novel tasks to 0.43, and a visual prediction stage running alongside action
raises it further to 0.55. A causal cascade that derives actions from the predicted future observations raises
performance to 0.62 and recovers the full model.
Localization accuracy. We evaluate localization accuracy on the novel tasks, using ground-truth progress
values provided by the alignment module. The predicted progress ˆ𝑝𝑡closely tracks the ground-truth 𝑝𝑡across
all steps, as presented in Fig. 10B, with a mean absolute error of 0.013 in normalized progress. This error stays
consistently small throughout, indicating that the localization stage tracks the progress of the robot within the
video demonstration reliably.
Visual prediction quality. Fig. 10C presents qualitative visual predictions on novel tasks. The predicted
future observations follow the behavior demonstrated in the human video and translate it into the robot’s own
embodiment and deployment scene. This translation remains accurate across variations in object appearance
and initial configuration, demonstrating the reliability of self-grounded prediction under variations in scene,
viewpoint, and embodiment encountered at deployment.
2.10
Effect of Same-Embodiment Pretraining
HOST uses same-embodiment robot–robot pairs in Stage 1 to build the capacity to follow a demonstrated
procedure, which Stage 2 then adapts to human video demonstrations using a smaller set of human–robot
pairs. To quantify the contribution of this pretraining to skill acquisition from a single human video, we train
variants on different fractions of the Stage 1 same-embodiment data while holding the Stage 2 adaptation data
fixed, evaluating each variant on the same held-out novel tasks listed in Fig. 5. The 0% condition, trained only
on the limited Stage 2 human–robot pairs, performs poorly, confirming that these pairs alone are insufficient
to build the capacity to follow a demonstrated procedure. As reported in Fig. 10D, success on novel tasks
then increases monotonically as the volume of Stage 1 data grows. A larger volume of same-embodiment
pretraining data exposes the model to a wider range of robot states and object configurations, strengthening
its capacity to localize progress within a video demonstration, translate its upcoming progression into the
robot’s own future observations, and derive actions from those predicted observations. Stage 2 then adapts
these capacities from robot videos to human video demonstrations. Same-embodiment pretraining therefore
supplies the capacity needed for skill acquisition from a single human video, reducing reliance on scarce
human–robot paired data.
2.11
Persistence of Acquired Skills across Recurring Tasks
HOST acquires each novel skill from a single human video. This video can then be stored and retrieved
without repeated human involvement, enabling the acquired skill to persist across recurring tasks. HOST thus
accumulates these stored videos into a reusable store of previously acquired skills. We evaluate this persistence
mechanism along three dimensions. We measure its accuracy in retrieving the correct video for a recurring
task, its reliability in recognizing a genuinely novel task and requesting a new human video, and its execution
reliability with a retrieved video relative to a freshly recorded one.

Stage 2 adaptation data held fixed. (E) Retrieval and execution reliability. Recall of recurring tasks and recognition of
novel tasks are jointly high across a broad range of similarity thresholds, and execution from a retrieved demonstration
matches the performance of a freshly provided one.
Retrieval reliability. Each video demonstration is stored together with its task instruction and initial scene,
enabling later encounters of the same or a similar task to retrieve it directly. Each requested task is posed
as a query. Its instruction and current scene are compared with every stored entry through the weighted
combination of instruction and scene similarity defined in Eq. 20. The entry with the highest score above a
threshold 𝛿is retrieved. HOST operates at a single fixed threshold 𝛿★across all tasks, retrieving the correct
stored video for a recurring task and recognizing a genuinely novel task, requesting a new human video instead,
as shown in Fig. 10E. This threshold balances two error modes, a value set too low admits false matches that
reuse an unrelated stored video, whereas a value set too high rejects valid matches and triggers unnecessary
requests for a new human video. Retrieval accuracy and recognition of novel tasks remain high across a wide
band of thresholds separating these two failure modes, and 𝛿★is chosen well within that band. This wide
margin keeps HOST reliable regardless of the exact choice of 𝛿.
Execution reliability from retrieved videos. Recurring tasks proceed without repeated human involvement,
which requires retrieval to both locate the correct video and support execution as reliable as a freshly recorded
one. HOST acquires and executes each skill without any parameter update, and retrieval therefore substitutes
only the source of the video demonstration, with the same frozen model processing it exactly as it would a
freshly recorded video. Fig. 10E compares execution driven by a retrieved video with execution driven by a
freshly recorded video on both previously mastered and novel tasks. The corresponding success rates match
the HOST averages reported in Figs. 7 and 5. The two settings achieve comparable performance with only a
small residual gap.

## sec:discussion Discussion
_Pages 16-17_

The ability to acquire new skills rapidly and effortlessly while retaining those already mastered is essential for
robots operating in human environments. However, current methods still acquire each new skill through a
cumbersome training-time loop that is costly, slow and self-defeating. Collecting task-specific demonstrations
consumes expert labor and scarce robot time, offline fine-tuning extends over hours before each new skill
becomes available, and updating the shared policy parameters erodes skills already mastered. We therefore
propose HOST, which moves novel skill acquisition from this loop to inference. From a single human video,
HOST acquires each new skill and executes it without any parameter update.
Realizing this paradigm, however, confronts a fundamental problem rooted in the structural mismatch between
video demonstration and execution. Temporal asynchrony between the video demonstration and the robot
execution decouples the prediction target from the video demonstration. State discrepancies in embodiment,
viewpoint and appearance further hinder translating the observed behavior into action. Addressing this
mismatch calls for a new formulation of how a robot acquires a skill from a demonstration. The central idea
of HOST is to treat skill acquisition as a process driven by the video demonstration and resolved through
self-grounded prediction, built on two principles. First, the video demonstration actively determines the robot’s
prediction target. HOST couples this target to the upcoming progression of the video demonstration on a
shared task progress manifold, turning the video into the active driver of the robot’s prediction. Second, HOST
resolves execution through a causal cascade of self-grounded prediction. This cascade first localizes where the
robot stands within the demonstrated procedure, then translates its upcoming progression into the robot’s
own future observations, and finally derives actions from these predicted observations. HOST thereby enables
the robot to actively follow the demonstrated procedure and adapt it to the robot’s own embodiment.
HOST acquires manipulation skills in seconds from a single human video, while retaining those already
mastered. HOST reaches 62% average success on novel tasks without any parameter update, acquiring each
skill in approximately 29 seconds. HOST exceeds the strongest one-shot visual imitation baseline by 43% even
though that baseline receives the same single human video, and the strongest zero-shot imitation learning
baseline by 45%. Even compared with the strongest baseline fine-tuned on 50 robot demonstrations per task,
HOST achieves superior performance while using 50 times fewer demonstrations and acquiring each new skill
507 times faster. This performance does not come at the cost of previously mastered skills. HOST retains these
skills, whereas even the strongest fine-tuned baseline retains only 43% of its original performance. A human
video can also be stored and retrieved to support recurring tasks without repeated human involvement.
HOST may also point toward a new possibility for skill acquisition in embodied agents. A robot could
autonomously and continually learn new skills by observing the people around it. For example, a household
robot could observe the people it lives with, while a factory robot could observe nearby workers. Realizing
this requires two capabilities, learning new skills directly from human video and continuing to acquire them
over time. HOST, built on coupling prediction targets to the demonstration and resolving execution through
self-grounded prediction, operates directly on human video and enables the robot to actively follow the
observed activity and adapt it to its own embodiment without any parameter update. This allows a robot to
learn new skills directly from human video at low cost. Each video keeps the acquired skill in external context
rather than encoding it in the policy weights. This video can then be stored and retrieved without repeated
human involvement, enabling the acquired skill to persist across recurring tasks. A robot can thus accumulate
these stored demonstrations without eroding previously acquired skills, continuing to acquire new skills over
time.
Despite its contributions, this work has several limitations that warrant further investigation. First, our
evaluations are conducted on a single bimanual manipulation platform, and HOST remains untested on robots
that differ substantially in embodiment. Training on human–robot paired data from a wider range of robots
would extend HOST to these platforms. Second, video demonstrations capture the manipulation procedure
without conveying the contact forces relevant to fine-grained manipulation (43). Capturing these contact
forces, for instance with wearable sensors such as tactile gloves, is a promising direction for future iterations.
Finally, HOST retrieves stored demonstrations by combining instruction and scene similarities between each
stored demonstration and the requested task. As the memory grows, this similarity may not reliably separate
tasks whose instructions and scenes differ only subtly, and capturing these finer distinctions is a direction for

4.1
Problem Formulation and Method Overview
Problem formulation. Let M = Mtrain ∪Mtest denote a set of manipulation tasks partitioned into disjoint
training and testing subsets. Each task 𝑚∈Mtrain is associated with a language instruction ℓ, a set of video
demonstrations {𝜏𝑑
𝑖}𝑁𝑑
𝑖=1, and a set of robot trajectories {𝜏𝑟
𝑗}𝑁𝑟
𝑗=1 that accomplish the same manipulation goal
under potentially different embodiments and scene configurations. A video demonstration 𝜏𝑑
𝑖= {𝑜𝑑
𝑡}𝑇𝑖
𝑡=1
records a demonstrator performing the task as a sequence of 𝑇𝑖visual observations, with 𝑜𝑑
𝑡∈O𝑑. A robot
trajectory 𝜏𝑟
𝑗= {(𝑜𝑟
𝑡, 𝑠𝑟
𝑡, 𝑎𝑡)}
𝑡=1 records the robot carrying out the same task and comprises observations 𝑜𝑟
𝑡∈O𝑟,
proprioceptive states 𝑠𝑟
𝑡∈S, and executed actions 𝑎𝑡∈A. Although a video demonstration and a trajectory
realize the same manipulation goal, they differ in length, with 𝑁𝑗generally differing from 𝑇𝑖, and may further
differ in viewpoint, embodiment, execution dynamics, scene layout, and object instance. The model, trained on
Mtrain, is evaluated on a disjoint test set Mtest, where each task provides only a single video demonstration. The
objective is to learn a policy 𝜋𝜃(𝑎𝑡| 𝜏𝑑, ℓ, 𝑜𝑟
𝑡-𝐾:𝑡, 𝑠𝑟
𝑡) that, given a video demonstration, a language instruction,
recent observations and the current proprioceptive state of the robot, generalizes to novel tasks without
parameter updates, thereby enabling inference-time skill acquisition while preserving previously learned
capabilities.
Method overview. HOST is built on a mechanistic view of skill acquisition from a single video demonstration.
Such a video demonstration does not directly specify the actions for robot execution, and a structural mismatch
exists between the video demonstration and robot execution. The video demonstration and robot execution
unfold asynchronously, decoupling the prediction target from the video demonstration and relegating it to a
passive context. The video demonstration and the robot trajectory also differ in embodiment, viewpoint and
appearance, and these discrepancies hinder the direct translation of the observed behaviour into robot action.
As illustrated in Fig. 2, HOST comprises two core mechanisms, coupling prediction targets to the demonstration
and resolving execution through self-grounded prediction, that together resolve the structural mismatch
between the video demonstration and robot execution. First, it couples the prediction target at each robot
timestep to the upcoming progression of the video demonstration (Sec. 4.2), through a monotonic frame-level
correspondence that maps the video demonstration and the robot trajectory onto a shared task progress
manifold, learned self-supervised without frame-level annotation. Second, it predicts the target through a
cascade of self-grounded prediction (Sec. 4.3). Given a video demonstration, recent robot observations 𝑜𝑟
𝑡-𝐾:𝑡
and state 𝑠𝑟
𝑡, and an optional language instruction ℓ, it first localizes the robot’s current stage within the
video demonstration, then translates its upcoming progression into the robot’s own future observations, and
finally derives robot actions. It is pretrained on large-scale same-embodiment paired data and adapted to
human-to-robot scenarios with a small set of human–robot pairs.
After training, HOST is able to acquire novel skills from a single human video demonstration at inference time.
Given a single human video of an unseen task, the video drives the same coupled, self-grounded prediction,
and the robot acts without any parameter update. A new skill therefore enters through the video at inference
time, relocating skill acquisition from the training-time loop to inference.
4.2
Coupling Prediction Targets to the Demonstration
A video demonstration and a robot execution of the same task are not temporally synchronized, unfolding as
two independent processes at different speeds. This decouples the prediction target, tied to progress along the
robot trajectory, from the video demonstration content, relegating the video demonstration to a passive context
and hindering the model from acquiring novel skills from the video demonstration at inference time. We
address this by coupling prediction targets to the demonstration. The prediction target at each robot timestep
is redefined as a dynamic segment of the robot’s own future trajectory, which step-wise corresponds to the
upcoming evolution of the video demonstration. These coupled targets are constructed from a monotonic
frame-level correspondence recovered by an alignment module, trained self-supervised on same-task trajectory
pairs from Mtrain with Smooth Dynamic Time Warping (44) and temporal cycle-consistency (45), without
frame-level annotation.
Task progress alignment. Given a video demonstration 𝜏𝑑= {𝑜𝑑
𝑡}𝑇
𝑡=1 and a robot trajectory 𝜏𝑟= {𝑜𝑟
𝑡}𝑁
𝑡=1 of
the same task, a shared frame embedding model 𝑓𝜙, built on Qwen3-VL-Embedding-8B (46) and trained
end-to-end during alignment training, encodes each frame into a 𝑑emb-dimensional embedding. For each
timestep of the trajectory, multi-view observations from all cameras are organized as an image sequence and
fed to the model, with an [EOS] token appended at the end. The per-timestep representation ℎ𝑡∈ℝ𝐷is
derived from the hidden state of the last layer corresponding to this [EOS] token. A linear projection followed
by ℓ2 normalization maps ℎ𝑡into a 𝑑emb-dimensional embedding e𝑡:
ℎ𝑡= 𝑓𝜙(𝑜𝑡),
e𝑡=
𝑃ℎ𝑡
∥𝑃ℎ𝑡∥2
(1)
where 𝑃∈ℝ𝑑emb×𝐷is a learnable projection matrix. Applying the same model to the video demonstration
and the robot trajectory yields embedding sequences d = {d1, . . . , d𝑇} and r = {r1, . . . , r𝑁} of lengths 𝑇and 𝑁,
respectively.
A pairwise similarity matrix 𝑆∈ℝ𝑇×𝑁is computed from the negative squared L2 distance between embeddings,
scaled by a temperature parameter 𝜅. Column-wise log-softmax normalization (44) then converts 𝑆into a
pairwise cost matrix 𝐶, controlled by a column-normalization temperature 𝛾𝑓:
𝑆𝑖𝑗= −∥d𝑖−r𝑗∥2/𝜅,
𝑐(𝑖, 𝑗) = −log
exp(𝑆𝑖𝑗/𝛾𝑓)
𝑘=1 exp(𝑆𝑘𝑗/𝛾𝑓)
(2)
Smooth Dynamic Time Warping (44) then recovers monotonic soft matching probabilities from the cost matrix
through a forward–backward dynamic programming procedure. The forward pass computes a cumulative cost
table 𝑅, in which 𝑅(𝑖, 𝑗) is the cost of the optimal monotonic path from (1, 1) to (𝑖, 𝑗):
𝑅(𝑖, 𝑗) = 𝑐(𝑖, 𝑗) + smoothMin 𝑅(𝑖−1, 𝑗−1), 𝑅(𝑖−1, 𝑗), 𝑅(𝑖, 𝑗−1); 𝛾
(3)
where smoothMin is a differentiable approximation to the minimum operator, parameterized by a smoothness
constant 𝛾> 0 that reduces to the hard minimum as 𝛾→0:
smoothMin(a; 𝛾) =
𝑘𝑎𝑘exp(−𝑎𝑘/𝛾)
𝑙exp(−𝑎𝑙/𝛾)
(4)
The backward pass computes 𝐸analogously, in which 𝐸(𝑖, 𝑗) is the cost of the optimal monotonic path from
(𝑖, 𝑗) to (𝑇, 𝑁). The soft matching probabilities are obtained by combining 𝑅and 𝐸and normalizing each row:
𝛽𝑑→𝑟
exp −𝛾−1(𝑅(𝑖, 𝑗) + 𝐸(𝑖, 𝑗))
𝑘=1 exp −𝛾−1(𝑅(𝑖, 𝑘) + 𝐸(𝑖, 𝑘)) ,
(5)
where 𝛽𝑑→𝑟
represents the probability that timestep 𝑖of d corresponds to timestep 𝑗of r. The monotonic
transition structure in Eq. 3, which only permits advancing along 𝑖, 𝑗, or both, constrains 𝛽𝑑→𝑟to concentrate
on temporally ordered correspondences. The reverse matching probabilities 𝛽𝑟→𝑑∈ℝ𝑁×𝑇are computed
analogously from 𝑆⊤.
Coupling prediction targets to the demonstration. The monotonic transition structure of Smooth DTW
encourages the learned matching distributions to concentrate along temporally ordered paths. This struc-
ture allows direct extraction of bidirectional frame correspondences through rowwise maximum probability
assignment.
𝜋𝑟→𝑑(𝑡) = arg max
𝛽𝑟→𝑑
𝜋𝑑→𝑟(𝑡) = arg max
𝛽𝑑→𝑟
(6)
For a robot at timestep 𝑡, the mapping 𝜋𝑟→𝑑locates the video demonstration frame corresponding to the
current execution stage. The 𝐻video demonstration frames following this position define the upcoming
video demonstration segment. Mapping each of these frames back to the robot trajectory via 𝜋𝑑→𝑟yields 𝐻
corresponding robot timesteps, and the robot trajectory segment T𝑡at these timesteps constitutes the prediction
target:
𝑡𝑖= 𝜋𝑑→𝑟 𝜋𝑟→𝑑(𝑡) + 𝑖
𝑖= 0, 1, . . . , 𝐻−1,
T𝑡= {𝜏𝑟
𝑡0, . . . , 𝜏𝑟
𝑡𝐻−1}.
(7)
Since the mappings are monotonic, the target comprises an ordered sequence of aligned robot timesteps
whose temporal extent is determined by the alignment.
This formulation strictly binds the prediction target T𝑡to the video demonstration, with T𝑡directly defined by
the video demonstration segment {𝑜𝑑
𝜋𝑟→𝑑(𝑡), . . . , 𝑜𝑑
𝜋𝑟→𝑑(𝑡)+𝐻−1}. To reduce encoding cost and enable the model to
attend to the video demonstration content most relevant to the current robot state, a sliding window W of 𝐿≥𝐻
video demonstration frames centered around the coupled segment is randomly selected and fed to the model
in place of the full video demonstration 𝜏𝑑. The current progress of the robot within W is recorded as a scalar
localization label 𝑝𝑡, supervising the model to localize its current task stage within the video demonstration
window and adaptively extract the relevant segment, which further enables autonomous window advancement
at inference time. Each training sample is formally defined as a tuple (W, 𝑜𝑟
𝑡−𝐾:𝑡, 𝑠𝑟
𝑡, ℓ, 𝑝𝑡, T𝑡), where T𝑡
comprises a future observation component T 𝑜
= {𝑜𝑟
𝑡0, . . . , 𝑜𝑟
𝑡𝐻−1} and an action component T 𝑎
= {𝑎𝑡0, . . . , 𝑎𝑡𝐻−1}.
Self-supervised alignment objective. To optimize the embedding network in a self-supervised manner and
obtain accurate matching probabilities 𝛽, two complementary losses are applied. We describe the 𝑑→𝑟
direction below. The reverse direction follows by symmetry.
A temporal cycle-consistency loss (45) enforces frame-level correspondence by constraining each frame to cycle
back to itself, matched to its nearest neighbor in the other sequence and then matched back. The loss penalizes
the temporal deviation between the original frame and the cycled-back frame. For each video demonstration
frame d𝑖, the soft nearest neighbor ˜r𝑖in r and the cycle-back distribution ˆ𝛽𝑖over d are computed as:
˜r𝑖=
𝑗=1
𝛽𝑑→𝑟
r𝑗,
ˆ𝛽𝑖𝑘=
exp(˜r⊤
𝑖d𝑘/𝜅)
𝑙=1 exp(˜r⊤
𝑖d𝑙/𝜅)
(8)
From ˆ𝛽𝑖, the cycle-back prediction 𝜇𝑖and its variance 𝜈2
𝑖are derived, and the loss penalizes deviations of 𝜇𝑖
from the original index 𝑖:
𝜇𝑖=
ˆ𝛽𝑖𝑘𝑘,
ˆ𝛽𝑖𝑘(𝑘−𝜇𝑖)2,
LTCC = 1
𝑖=1
(𝑖−𝜇𝑖)2
+ 𝜆log 𝜈𝑖
(9)
To further encourage globally coherent alignments beyond per-frame consistency, a DTW loss minimizes the
total alignment cost between the two sequences, computed as the forward table value at the terminal cell
normalized by sequence length:
LDTW = 𝑅(𝑇, 𝑁)
𝑇+ 𝑁.
(10)
The two losses are symmetrized over both directions, and the total alignment loss is Lalign = LTCC+𝜆DTW LDTW.
4.3
Resolving Execution through Self-Grounded Prediction
Beyond temporal alignment, the video demonstrations and the robot trajectories differ in embodiment,
viewpoint and appearance. Directly deriving robot actions from the video demonstration forces the model
to resolve intractable cross-domain ambiguities, hindering translation into precise action. Inspired by the
causal cascade of human observational learning (32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38), we propose resolving execution
through self-grounded prediction. We localize the robot’s current progress within the video demonstration,
translate its upcoming progression into the robot’s own future observations conditioned on the localized
segment, and derive robot actions from these future observations. We model this causal cascade within a
single autoregressive diffusion model, as illustrated in Fig. 2B. The generation targets are arranged in a causal
token sequence in which each output is conditioned on all preceding ones and jointly optimized in a single
forward pass.
Input representation. All visual elements, including the video demonstration window W, recent robot
observations 𝑜𝑟
𝑡-𝐾:𝑡, and the future observations T 𝑜
𝑡, are encoded into a shared latent space by the Wan
VAE (47), yielding video demonstration tokens 𝑧𝑑, robot observation tokens 𝑧𝑜, and target observation tokens
𝑦𝑜. The localization value 𝑝𝑡and the action sequence T 𝑎
are projected to the hidden dimension of the model
through separate learnable linear layers, producing a localization token 𝑦𝑝= 𝐸𝑝(𝑝𝑡) and action tokens 𝑦𝑎. To
implement autoregressive generation via flow matching, each generation target is represented as a token pair,
one noisy and one clean, where the noisy token serves as the denoising input and the clean token conditions
subsequent targets:
𝜎=(1−𝜎) 𝑦𝑝+ 𝜎𝜖𝑝,
𝜎=(1−𝜎) 𝑦𝑜+ 𝜎𝜖𝑜,
𝜎=(1−𝜎) 𝑦𝑎+ 𝜎𝜖𝑎.
(11)
The complete token sequence places the context tokens first, followed by the target pairs in causal order:
[ 𝑧𝑑∥𝑧𝑜∥𝑦𝑝
𝜎, 𝑦𝑝∥𝑦𝑜
𝜎, 𝑦𝑜∥𝑦𝑎
𝜎],
(12)
Architecture. The model adopts a dual-expert Mixture-of-Transformer (48) architecture built on the Wan
video diffusion backbone (47). A video expert, initialized from Wan2.2 (47), handles localization and future
observation prediction. An action expertwith the same depth but reduced hidden dimension handles action
generation, a reduction afforded by the lower distributional complexity of actions relative to observations. The
two experts share self-attention by concatenating their respective query, key, and value projections at each
layer, with Qve, Kve, Vve for the video expertand Qae, Kae, Vae for the action expert:
Q = [Qve | Qae],
K = [Kve | Kae],
V = [Vve | Vae],
(13)
The joint attention output is then split and processed by expert-specific feed-forward networks. Both experts
additionally receive a cross-attention conditioning sequence 𝑐at every layer, consisting of the language
instruction encoded by the UMT5-XXL text encoder (49) and the proprioceptive state 𝑠𝑟
𝑡projected via a
learnable matrix 𝑀𝑠:
𝑐= [UMT5(ℓ) | 𝑀𝑠𝑠𝑟
𝑡].
(14)
Autoregressive causal structure. The causal order among the localization token, the future observation
tokens, and the action tokens is enforced through the self-attention mask. Each noisy target token attends
to the video demonstration tokens 𝑧𝑑, the robot observation tokens 𝑧𝑜, and the clean tokens of all preceding
targets, while attention to concurrent and subsequent targets is blocked. During training, the clean tokens are
set to ground-truth representations, and gradients through the clean tokens are detached so that gradients
from each target loss do not propagate through preceding clean targets. The localization, observation, and
action tokens are therefore optimized jointly in a single forward pass. To bridge the gap between training and
inference, the ground-truth localization value and future observations serving as clean tokens are augmented
with small-magnitude Gaussian noise during training.
Training objective. The model predicts a velocity for the noisy token of each target following the causal order
established above, denoted ˆ𝑣𝑝, ˆ𝑣𝑜and ˆ𝑣𝑎for the localization, observation and action targets. Each is trained
with a flow matching objective (50) that compares the predicted velocity against the target:
Lloc =
ˆ𝑣𝑝−(𝜖𝑝−𝑦𝑝)
2 ,
Lobs = ∥ˆ𝑣𝑜−(𝜖𝑜−𝑦𝑜)∥2 ,
(15)
Lact = ∥ˆ𝑣𝑎−(𝜖𝑎−𝑦𝑎)∥2 .
The total training loss is formulated as:
L = 𝜆𝑝Lloc + 𝜆𝑜Lobs + 𝜆𝑎Lact.
(16)
4.4
Training and Inference
Two-stage training. Human–robot paired data would directly supervise the re-expression of a demonstrated
procedure across embodiment, but such data remain scarce, impeding the development of reliable skill
acquisition from a single human video. HOST instead develops the capacity to follow a demonstrated procedure
first, then adapts it to human video demonstrations through a two-stage training protocol that reduces reliance
on this scarce supervision. Stage 1 develops this capacity from readily available same-embodiment robot–robot
pairs, and Stage 2 adapts it to human video demonstrations with a smaller set of human–robot pairs.
In Stage 1, HOST is pretrained on large-scale same-embodiment robot–robot pairs. Different executions of the
same task provide natural supervision for prediction conditioned on a video demonstration, with one trajectory
serving as the video demonstration and another providing the robot’s own future observations and actions.
This stage teaches the model to localize progress, predict future observations and generate actions conditioned
on a demonstrated procedure, without requiring cross-embodiment transfer. The video demonstrations used
in this stage are exclusively robotic.
In Stage 2, the pretrained model is adapted with a smaller collection of human–robot paired demonstrations.
The prediction targets remain drawn from the robot’s own future trajectory, whereas the conditioning video
demonstration is drawn from human video. This stage adapts the mechanism learned from robot–robot pairs to
the harder setting in which task structure must be recovered across discrepancies that extend beyond viewpoint
and appearance to a further difference in embodiment. Both stages optimize the same objective in Eq. 16,
allowing the model to reuse the same self-grounded prediction across same-embodiment and cross-embodiment
settings.
The alignment module described in Sec. 4.2 is pretrained on paired same-task trajectories spanning both
same-embodiment and cross-embodiment settings. Once trained, it is used to construct training samples for
the policy model, with prediction targets coupled to the video demonstration.
Inference-time skill acquisition. After training, HOST acquires each new skill at inference time from a video,
which serves as an external specification of the task and drives execution without any per-task training. Given
a video demonstration 𝜏𝑑and a language instruction ℓ, the model initializes the video demonstration window
at frame index 𝑤0 = 0 and repeatedly performs the same causal inference loop, localizing the robot’s current
progress within the video demonstration, predicting the robot’s own future observations from the upcoming
progression of the video demonstration, and generating an action chunk to realize those observations. The
video demonstration window is advanced according to the predicted progress, allowing the robot to follow the
demonstrated task structure.
At step 𝑡, the model receives the current video demonstration window W𝑡, recent robot observations 𝑜𝑟
𝑡−𝐾:𝑡,
proprioceptive state 𝑠𝑟
𝑡and language instruction ℓ. The localization token 𝑦𝑝, the future observation tokens
𝑦𝑜and the action tokens 𝑦𝑎are generated sequentially from noise, with each completed output conditioning
subsequent targets:
ˆ𝑦𝑖= Denoise(𝑧𝑑, 𝑧𝑜, 𝑐, ˆ𝑦<𝑖),
𝑖∈{𝑝, 𝑜, 𝑎},
(17)
where ˆ𝑦<𝑖denotes the preceding generated outputs in the causal order 𝑝→𝑜→𝑎. Each denoising process
can use an independently configured number of steps.
The generated localization ˆ𝑦𝑝indicates the relative progress of the robot ˆ𝑝𝑡within the current video demonstra-
tion window. This relative position is converted into an absolute frame index ˆ𝑞𝑡in the full video demonstration,
and the next window is centered on this estimate:
ˆ𝑞𝑡= 𝑤𝑡+ ⌊ˆ𝑝𝑡𝐿⌋,
𝑤𝑡+1 = ˆ𝑞𝑡−⌊𝐿/2⌋.
(18)
Here 𝑤𝑡is the start frame index of W𝑡in 𝜏𝑑. The predicted action chunk ˆ𝑦𝑎is executed for 𝐻steps, after
which the loop continues with the updated window W𝑡+1.
Persistence across recurring tasks. HOST acquires and executes each novel task from a single video
demonstration 𝜏𝑑. Each video demonstration is preserved in a demonstration memory B together with its
task instruction and initial scene, enabling a subsequent encounter of the same or a similar task to retrieve
it directly without repeated human involvement. The requested task is posed as a query. Its instruction and
current scene are compared with the stored entries, and the demonstration with the highest match score above
a similarity threshold 𝛿is retrieved. Otherwise, HOST recognizes the task as genuinely novel and requests a
new human video.
Each video demonstration 𝜏𝑑
𝑖is stored in B together with its language instruction ℓ𝑖, a text embedding
𝑒text
∈ℝ𝑑emb of the instruction, and a scene embedding 𝑒img
∈ℝ𝑑emb of the initial observation. Qwen3-VL-
Embedding-8B (46) maps both modalities into a shared 𝑑emb-dimensional space with ℓ2 normalization:
𝑒text
𝑔𝜓(ℓ𝑖)
∥𝑔𝜓(ℓ𝑖)∥2
𝑒img
𝑔𝜓(𝑜𝑑
∥𝑔𝜓(𝑜𝑑
1)∥2
(19)
where 𝑔𝜓denotes the Qwen3-VL-Embedding-8B encoder and 𝑜𝑑
1 is the initial image frame of 𝜏𝑑
The requested task supplies an instruction ℓ𝑞and the current robot observation 𝑜𝑟, encoded into query
embeddings 𝑒text
and 𝑒img
following Eq. 19. Each stored video demonstration 𝜏𝑑
𝑖is then scored by a weighted
combination of instruction and scene cosine similarities:
𝑠𝑖= 𝜔cos(𝑒text
, 𝑒text
) + (1 −𝜔) cos(𝑒img
, 𝑒img
(20)
where 𝜔balances instruction and scene similarity. The video demonstration with the highest score above
𝛿is selected and supplied to the inference pipeline as 𝜏𝑑. Otherwise, HOST requests a new human video to
execute the task, which is then stored in B for later reuse.

A.1
Learning Robot Manipulation from Demonstrations
Learning from demonstrations offers a direct and intuitive way to teach robots new manipulation skills. This
section first reviews imitation learning and then discusses two directions that have become prominent in
robot learning research, vision–language–action foundation models and world models that incorporate video
generation and future prediction.
A.1.1
Imitation learning from robot and human demonstrations
Teaching robots to replicate human motor skills is a long-standing objective in robotics (51, 52). Imitation
learning, or learning from demonstrations (LfD), formulates the problem as recovering a policy from expert
state–action trajectories obtained via teleoperation or kinesthetic teaching (12, 53, 54). When the expert
and the robot share the same embodiment, behavioral cloning provides an effective framework (55). Recent
advances in policy architectures have further improved these approaches. Diffusion Policy (17) models robot
action distributions with denoising diffusion processes and achieves strong multimodal behavior coverage.
ACT (18) introduces transformer-based action chunking for fine-grained bimanual manipulation on low-cost
hardware. These methods have substantially improved the performance attainable through imitation learning
when high-quality robot demonstrations are available.
The setting becomes substantially harder when the demonstrator is human, as the embodiment, viewpoint,
and dynamics differ from those of the robot. Retargeting methods extract human hand or body poses from
video and map them to robot joint configurations through hand-crafted or learned correspondence (56, 57),
while methods for domain adaptation instead learn embodiment-invariant representations that bridge the
visual or state-space gap between human and robot observations (58, 59). A further line of work leverages
human activity directly as a learning signal, learning latent plans or behavioral priors from unstructured
human play and in-the-wild video (60, 61, 62). Most recently, EgoScale (63) establishes a log-linear scaling
law between egocentric video data and downstream robot performance, demonstrating that large-scale human
video pretraining followed by intermediate training on robot data yields substantial gains with minimal robot
supervision (64, 65, 66).
A.1.2
Vision–language–action models
The convergence of large-scale pretraining and robot learning has given rise to vision–language–action (VLA)
models that unify perception, language understanding, and robot action generation in a single architecture (67).
Early efforts such as Gato (68) demonstrate that a single transformer can be trained across vision, language, and
control modalities, albeit with limited manipulation performance. RT-1 (19) shows that training a high-capacity
transformer on large-scale robot demonstrations yields robust real-world manipulation policies. RT-2 (13)
extends this approach by jointly fine-tuning a vision–language model on robot action data, which transfers
web-scale visual and semantic concepts to robotic control. The Open X-Embodiment initiative (20) further
shows that co-training across diverse embodiments and institutions yields positive transfer, with the resulting
RT-X models exhibiting improved performance over single-embodiment baselines.
A broader wave of VLA models has since extended this paradigm across architectures, scales, and embodiments.
Octo (21) provides a generalist policy that can be efficiently fine-tuned to new robots and tasks, while
OpenVLA (69) offers an open-source VLA trained on the Open X-Embodiment dataset. 𝜋0 (14) introduces
flow matching into the VLA framework, achieving state-of-the-art dexterous manipulation and multi-stage
task execution, and its successor 𝜋0.5 (15) demonstrates open-world generalization to novel environments
through large-scale co-training on heterogeneous data, including cross-embodiment robot demonstrations and
web data. RDT-1B (70) scales diffusion-based policies to one billion parameters for bimanual manipulation,
and GR00T N1 (71) provides a foundation model for generalist humanoid robot control through a joint
vision–language–action architecture. DexVLA (72) introduces a modular diffusion expert plugged into a VLA
backbone for dexterous manipulation.
A.1.3
World models and video generation for robot learning
World models that predict future states have a long history in robot control. Ha and Schmidhuber (73, 74)
demonstrate that recurrent world models learned in latent space can facilitate policy evolution. Dreamer (75)
learns behaviors by latent imagination, DreamerV2 (76) masters Atari with discrete world models, and
DreamerV3 (77) extends the approach to diverse domains. IRIS (78) introduces transformer-based world
models that achieve strong sample efficiency. In the continuous control setting, PlaNet (79) learns latent
dynamics for planning from pixels, and TD-MPC2 (80) provides scalable and robust latent-space world models.
With the advent of large-scale video generation, pixel-space world models have been explored for manipulation.
UniPi (81) generates future video frames as a planning representation. It converts goals specified in text
into visual plans, from which an inverse dynamics model extracts actions. SuSIE (82) refines this idea by
using a pretrained image-editing diffusion model to generate subgoal images that guide a goal-conditioned
policy. Gen2Act (83) generates human demonstration videos in novel scenarios to enable robot generalization,
and Dreamitate (84) leverages video generation of demonstrations to learn real-world visuomotor policies.
SWIM (85) pre-trains a world model from human videos and fine-tunes it on robot data, establishing that
human video provides useful dynamics priors for manipulation. UniSim (86) learns an interactive generative
simulator from real-world data, enabling policy training within the learned world model.
More recently, world-action models (WAMs) jointly train video prediction and action generation within a
shared architecture (87, 88, 89, 90, 41, 91). GR-1 (87) pretrains on large-scale video data and fine-tunes
for robot action prediction. GR-2 (88) extends this to tens of millions of internet video clips, improving
generalization. LingBot-VA (89) proposes a Mixture-of-Transformers architecture that jointly predicts future
frames and actions in a shared latent space via autoregressive diffusion, using closed-loop rollout for long-
horizon dexterous manipulation. Cosmos Policy (90) fine-tunes large video generation models as visuomotor
robot policies, demonstrating transfer from internet-scale video pretraining. Fast-WAM (41) shows that video co-
training, rather than explicit future imagination at test time, is the primary source of WAM performance gains.
Accordingly, removing test-time video generation yields 4× faster inference while maintaining competitive
performance.
Despite this progress, these methods struggle to generalize beyond the training distribution (92), and learning
a new skill typically requires additional task-specific demonstrations and offline training, a cycle that is costly,
slow, and risks catastrophic forgetting of previously acquired skills (25, 24). HOST instead acquires novel
manipulation skills at inference time from a single human video demonstration without any parameter update.
It achieves 62% average success on novel tasks and exceeds the strongest zero-shot imitation baseline by 45%.
Compared with supervised fine-tuning on 50 robot demonstrations per task, HOST achieves a higher success
rate and acquires each skill roughly 507 times faster.
A.2
One-Shot Visual Imitation
A.2.1
One-shot visual imitation methods
Kuniyoshi et al. (26) envisioned robots extracting reusable task knowledge from a single observed human
performance. This setting, now studied as one-shot visual imitation (OSVI), requires robots to bridge em-
bodiment and viewpoint differences and translate one observed performance into executable robot actions.
One line of work constructs modular pipelines that decompose this problem into perception, grounding, and
execution stages, estimating the target interaction pose or object configuration from the video demonstration
and replaying the resulting trajectory in open loop (93, 94, 95, 96). FMimic (93) leverages vision–language
models to extract fine-grained hand–object interaction keypoints from a human video demonstration, then
transfers these keypoints to novel scenes via region-to-keypoint mapping and refines execution with pose
estimation based on contact. MT3 (97) decomposes manipulation trajectories into alignment and interaction
phases and retrieves over a thousand tasks from as few as one video demonstration each, assuming the robot
grasps each object with the same pose as in the video demonstration. RSRD (98) recovers articulated 3D
part motions from monocular RGB video for bimanual imitation, depending on high-quality part-level 3D
reconstruction. Open-loop replay confines these pipelines to reproducing simple demonstrated behaviors
and limits the adaptation required for real-world deployment, and independently engineered modules also
introduce compounding errors that restrict generalization across diverse manipulation scenarios.
An alternative line of work seeks to learn a unified model that maps a human video demonstration and current
robot observations to robot actions (27, 28, 99, 100, 29, 39, 101, 30, 31, 102). Early efforts in this direction
adopt meta-learning. Finn et al. (27) propose meta-learning for one-shot visual imitation, and DAML (28)
extends this approach to cross-embodiment settings through domain adaptation. Pathak et al. (99) demonstrate
visual imitation from video without access to action labels. T-OSVI (100) uses transformers to capture long-
range dependencies in video demonstrations, supporting an embodiment mismatch between the demonstrator
and the robot. MOSAIC (29) establishes a more challenging evaluation protocol with completely unseen
test tasks, revealing that prior methods struggle to generalize beyond their training distribution. AWDA (39)
improves generalization through attributed waypoints and demonstration augmentation. DINOBot (101)
leverages vision foundation models for egocentric one-shot imitation via retrieval-based alignment. More
recently, Vid2Robot (30) encodes the demonstration video via a ViT–Perceiver architecture and conditions a
cross-attention transformer policy on the resulting tokens, augmented with temporal cycle-consistency and
video–text contrastive losses to align prompt and robot representations. OSVI-WM (31) introduces an approach
guided by a world model, in which a learned causal transformer world model iteratively predicts latent states
from concatenated demonstrator and robot representations, decoding the predicted trajectory into physical
waypoints. These end-to-end methods eliminate the need for manually designed module interfaces. However,
their performance still lags behind that of language-conditioned policies (15) and falls far short of that achieved
through task-specific fine-tuning. This gap suggests that learning novel manipulation skills from a single video
demonstration remains an open problem.
Existing OSVI methods continue to perform substantially worse than task-specific fine-tuning. This shortfall
reflects the structural mismatch between video demonstration and execution. Temporal asynchrony decouples
the prediction target from the video demonstration, while differences in embodiment, viewpoint, and ap-
pearance make the observed behavior difficult to translate into action. HOST resolves this mismatch through
coupling prediction targets to the demonstration and resolving execution through self-grounded prediction.
Rather than fixing the prediction target at a temporal offset independent of the video demonstration, HOST
couples each target to the video demonstration’s upcoming content on the shared task progress manifold,
turning the video into the active driver of the robot’s predicted actions. Execution is then resolved through
resolving execution through self-grounded prediction, a causal cascade that first localizes the robot’s progress
within the video demonstration, then predicts its own future observations, and finally derives actions from
these future observations.
A.3
Temporal Alignment and Correspondence Learning
A.3.1
Video temporal alignment methods
Temporal alignment of videos depicting the same process under different conditions is a fundamental problem
in video understanding. The differentiable formulation of Dynamic Time Warping has been a key enabler.
Soft-DTW (103) replaces the non-differentiable minimum operator in DTW with a soft-min, producing a
differentiable alignment loss that enables gradient-based optimization. D3TW (104) extends this with a
discriminative, margin-based loss for weakly supervised action alignment and segmentation.
A related line of work learns temporal representations in a self-supervised manner, without relying on frame-
level correspondence labels. Time-contrastive networks (TCN) (58) learn viewpoint-invariant representations
by enforcing temporal consistency across simultaneously recorded multi-view videos, enabling imitation from
observation by matching embeddings across human and robot demonstrations. Temporal cycle-consistency
(TCC) (45) extends this idea to unpaired videos. It learns per-frame embeddings so that a frame mapped to
its nearest neighbor in another video and then mapped back returns to its original position. This cycle enables
fine-grained alignment without frame-level supervision. Wang (105) proposes learning spatial correspondence
through forward-backward cycle-consistency in time, demonstrating that temporal consistency provides a
powerful self-supervisory signal. Hadji et al. (44) reformulate DTW as a differentiable probabilistic procedure
for path finding. The procedure serves directly as a training objective and extends naturally to a global
cycle-consistency loss. It produces monotonic soft matching probabilities for processes that share temporal
structure but differ in pace and appearance.
Within robot learning, temporal alignment has been applied to derive reward signals, identify correspondences
in task progress, and regularize policy training as an auxiliary loss. XIRL (59) derives cross-embodiment
reward functions from representations learned through temporal alignment, and GraphIRL (106) applies
graph abstraction with temporal matching to derive dense reward functions from videos. TCN (58) uses
temporal alignment to identify correspondences in task progress for imitation from observation. Vid2Robot (30)
incorporates temporal cycle-consistency as an auxiliary loss alongside video–text contrastive learning, which
aligns prompt and robot representations during policy training.
HOST instead uses temporal alignment as a structural mechanism that directly constructs the prediction target,
rather than an auxiliary loss or reward signal. A self-supervised alignment module, combining temporal cycle-
consistency (45) with differentiable monotonic path finding (44), recovers frame-level correspondence between
the video demonstration and the robot trajectory. Through coupling prediction targets to the demonstration,
this correspondence redefines the prediction target at each robot timestep. The target is redefined as the
segment of the robot’s own trajectory that corresponds to the future evolution of the video demonstration.
This construction establishes a direct causal dependency between the demonstration content and the training
objective, transforming the video from passive context into an active supervisory signal at each step.

Implementation Details
This section provides the complete implementation details for reproducing HOST, covering the alignment
module, autoregressive diffusion model architecture, training procedure, data processing, and inference
pipeline. Each subsection concludes with a hyperparameter summary table for easy reference.
B.1
Alignment Module
Vision encoder and embedding. The alignment module employs Qwen3-VL-Embedding-8B (46) as the
shared vision encoder 𝑓𝜙, loaded in bfloat16 with scaled dot-product attention and gradient checkpointing
enabled. The full model is fine-tuned end-to-end during alignment training. Each frame is processed through
the complete Qwen3-VL forward pass, and the per-frame representation is extracted from the [EOS] token
position in the last hidden layer, yielding a 𝐷=1,536-dimensional hidden state. A single learnable linear layer
projects the hidden state to a 𝑑=128-dimensional embedding, followed by ℓ2 normalization, as formulated in
Eq. 1. The same encoder and projection are applied to both the video demonstration and the robot trajectory.
Smooth DTW configuration. Smooth Dynamic Time Warping runs forward and backward passes to compute
bidirectional alignment. The forward pass accumulates costs along monotonic paths using the smooth minimum
operator formulated in Eq. 3, with softmin temperature 𝛾=1.0. A column-normalization temperature 𝛾𝑓=0.1
controls the sharpness of the matching probabilities. When both sequences share the same length, the
anti-diagonal parallel implementation reduces the computation from 𝑂(𝑇2) sequential steps to 𝑂(𝑇) parallel
anti-diagonal sweeps. Boundary conditions initialize the origin cell to its cost value and all border cells to
a large constant of 109. The backward table is computed analogously from the terminal cell. The matching
probabilities 𝛽are then obtained by combining the forward and backward tables and applying row-wise
softmax normalization, as formulated in Eq. 5. The pairwise similarity matrix uses negative squared L2
distance entries scaled by a softmax temperature 𝜅=0.1.
Loss configuration. The temporal cycle-consistency loss is defined in Eq. 9 and adopts variance-aware mean
squared error regression. The predicted cycle-back variance 𝜈2
𝑖is clamped with 𝜖=10−4 for numerical stability
under bfloat16, and the variance regularization weight is 𝜆var=0.001 with label smoothing of 0.1. The path-cost
loss weight is 𝜆DTW=0.3, normalized by the sum of sequence lengths 𝑇+𝑁, as formulated in Eq. 10. Both losses
are symmetrized over both alignment directions.
Training configuration. The module is trained with AdamW, using 𝛽1=0.9, 𝛽2=0.999, 𝜖=10−8, and weight
decay 10−5. The learning rate is 10−5 with cosine annealing over 100 warmup steps down to a minimum
ratio of 0.3. Training runs for 10,000 steps on 64 GPUs with a per-GPU batch size of 4, yielding an effective
batch size of 256. It uses bfloat16 mixed precision, DeepSpeed ZeRO-3, and gradient clipping at 3.0. Training
data comprises same-task trajectory pairs drawn from Mtrain, spanning both robot–robot and human–robot
configurations, with pairs formed by randomly selecting two distinct trajectories of the same task. Data
augmentation consists of random horizontal flipping and brightness/contrast jittering.
After training, the alignment module is frozen and used offline to construct the conditioning windows,
localization labels, and prediction targets for autoregressive diffusion model training, described in Sec. 4.2. At
inference time, the alignment module is not invoked. The autoregressive diffusion model autonomously tracks
task progress via the learned localization head, described in Sec. B.5. Hyperparameters are summarized in
Supplementary Table 1.

Autoregressive Diffusion Model Architecture
VAE. Robot visual observations and video demonstration frames are encoded by WanVideoVAE (47) with
48 latent channels and 8× spatial downsampling. Multi-view images from all three cameras are vertically
concatenated in pixel space prior to VAE encoding, producing a combined frame of height 224×3=672 pixels
that is mapped to an 84×28 latent grid per timestep. The VAE is frozen throughout training.
Video expert. The video expert is a 30-layer Diffusion Transformer (107) initialized from Wan2.2-TI2V-5B (47),
with hidden dimension 3,072, feed-forward dimension 14,336, 24 attention heads at 128 dimensions per
head, and patch size [1, 2, 2]. It processes the video demonstration tokens together with the current robot
observation and future observation tokens, so its predicted future observations remain grounded in the current
robot state. A causal attention mask on the first frame lets the first frame, the current robot observation,
attend only to its own tokens. All subsequent frames instead attend bidirectionally to all frames, including
the first. This design prevents the deterministic current observation from being contaminated by noisy future
observation tokens, while still letting the future observation tokens condition on the current observation.
Each transformer block employs Adaptive Layer Normalization (AdaLN) with six learned modulation compo-
nents per layer. These components comprise shift, scale, and gate for both self-attention and feed-forward
sub-layers. The diffusion timestep is embedded via sinusoidal encoding, followed by a two-layer MLP that maps
freq_dim =256 to hidden_dim. It is then projected to the six modulation parameters through a SiLU-activated
linear layer. Separated timestep embedding is used. The first frame always receives a clean timestep of
zero, while subsequent frames receive the actual diffusion timestep. This reflects the asymmetry between the
deterministic input observation and the noisy generation targets.
Three-dimensional rotary position embedding (3D RoPE) encodes spatial and temporal structure. Separate
frequency components for the temporal, height, and width axes are precomputed and applied to query and key
vectors via complex rotation. Video demonstration frames receive temporal positions [0, 1, . . . , 𝑓𝑑−1], robot
observation frames continue from [ 𝑓𝑑, . . . , 𝑓𝑑+ 𝑓𝑟−1], and the localization token receives a dedicated temporal
index one past all frames with zero spatial coordinates.
Video demonstration conditioning. Video demonstration tokens 𝑧𝑑are placed at the beginning of the
self-attention sequence, as formulated in Eq. 12. They participate in the shared self-attention computation
alongside robot observation and action tokens. The attention mask enforces unidirectional conditioning.
Video demonstration tokens attend only to other video demonstration tokens, through full self-attention
within the video demonstration window, while robot observation and action tokens can attend to the video
demonstration tokens. This design allows the model to extract information from the video demonstration
without it being influenced by the current robot state. When the video demonstration is dropped during
training, with probability 0.5, the corresponding tokens are replaced with zero padding and masked out of all
attention computations. The text description then serves as the sole task conditioning signal.
Headwise gating modulates the influence of video demonstration information at each attention head. Gate
parameters are initialized with zero weights and a bias of 5.0, starting the model with approximately neutral,
open gating and allowing task-specific attention patterns to emerge during training.
Action expert. The action expert is a 30-layer DiT with a hidden dimension of 1,024, a feed-forward dimension
of 4,096, and the same attention-head configuration as the video expert. Both use 24 heads with 128 dimensions
per head. This shared configuration permits shared self-attention in the MoT framework. Its query, key, and
value projections map the 1,024-dimensional hidden state to this shared 3,072-dimensional attention space.
The attention output is then projected back to 1,024 dimensions before the feed-forward sub-layer. Each action
step is independently encoded by a linear projection from the action dimension, mapping ℝ20 to ℝ1024. This
yields one token per timestep, for a total of 𝐻=32 action tokens. The action expert applies one-dimensional
RoPE over the action sequence.
The backbone parameters of the action expert are initialized from the video expert via dimension-wise linear
interpolation. For each weight tensor whose last dimension differs between the two experts, the pretrained
weights are linearly interpolated from 𝑑𝑣=3,072 to 𝑑𝑎=1,024 along that dimension. They are then scaled by
𝑑𝑣/𝑑𝑎to preserve the variance of activations despite the dimensional reduction. Action-specific parameters
that have no counterpart in the video expert, such as the input projection and output head, are initialized with
standard Kaiming uniform initialization. Headwise gating is applied to the self-attention in the action expert,
with the same zero-weight, bias-5.0 initialization.
Mixture-of-Transformers. In the MoT architecture, formulated in Eq. 13, the two experts share self-attention
by concatenating their query, key, and value projections at each layer. The joint attention output is then split
by expert and processed by branch-specific feed-forward networks. Gradient checkpointing is applied to the
mixed attention computation during training to reduce memory consumption.
Text and proprioceptive conditioning. The cross-attention conditioning sequence 𝑐is formulated in Eq. 14.
It comprises text embeddings encoded by UMT5-XXL (49) at 4,096 dimensions, with a context length of 512
and a maximum tokenizer length of 512. It also comprises the proprioceptive state, projected via a learnable
linear layer from ℝ20 to ℝ4096. Text embeddings are computed offline using the frozen UMT5-XXL encoder
and loaded during training. Both expert branches receive 𝑐via cross-attention at every transformer layer.
The framework accepts either a language instruction, a video demonstration, or both as task specification at
inference time.
Localization token. The scalar localization value 𝑝𝑡is projected to the hidden dimension of the video expert
by a learnable encoder 𝐸𝑝, a two-layer MLP with GELU activation. It maps ℝ1 to ℝ3072 and then to ℝ3072,
producing a single localization token. The decoder 𝐷𝑝maps the generated representation back to a scalar
prediction through LayerNorm followed by a two-layer MLP with GELU activation. This MLP maps ℝ3072 to
ℝ3072 and then to ℝ1.
To bridge the gap between ground-truth conditioning at training time and model-predicted conditioning at
inference, the clean progress token 𝑦𝑝is augmented with bounded Gaussian noise during training. This token
conditions subsequent generation targets, and the noise has standard deviation 0.5, applied with probability
0.5. The noised value is then clamped to [−1, 1]. This noisy clean progress (NCP) scheme improves the
robustness of autoregressive conditioning. Progress denoising uses a dedicated flow matching scheduler with
shift =3.0.
Autoregressive attention mask. The causal ordering among the three generation targets, described in Sec. 4.3,
is enforced through the self-attention mask. The noisy localization token can attend to 𝑧𝑑and 𝑧𝑜but not to
subsequent targets. The noisy observation tokens can attend to 𝑧𝑑, 𝑧𝑜, and the clean localization token, but
not to action tokens. The noisy action tokens can attend to 𝑧𝑑, 𝑧𝑜, the clean localization token, and the clean
observation tokens. During training, clean tokens are populated with ground-truth values and their gradients
are stopped so that each target’s loss does not back-propagate into preceding targets. Hyperparameters are
summarized in Supplementary Table 2.

Training Procedure
Stage 1 performs same-embodiment pretraining, and Stage 2 performs human–robot adaptation. Both stages
share an identical training configuration with full-parameter updates. The optimizer is AdamW with 𝛽1=0.9,
𝛽2=0.95, and weight decay 10−2. Training uses a constant learning rate of 10−5. Training is distributed across
64 GPUs with a per-GPU batch size of 2, yielding an effective batch size of 128. It uses bfloat16 mixed precision
and DeepSpeed ZeRO Stage 1. Gradients are clipped to a maximum norm of 1.0. No exponential moving
average (EMA) of model weights is used.
The loss weights are 𝜆𝑜=1.0, 𝜆𝑎=10.0, and 𝜆𝑝=1.0, as formulated in Eq. 16. The elevated action loss weight
compensates for the lower token count of the action sequence relative to the observation token grid and
ensures balanced gradient magnitudes across the two expert branches.
Flow matching configuration. Flow matching uses 1,000 training timesteps with a shift of 5.0 for both
observation and action schedulers, and a shift of 3.0 for the progress scheduler. All three targets follow the
same velocity-prediction parameterization, as formulated in Eq. 15. Timesteps 𝜎are sampled by drawing
𝑢∼Uniform[0, 1] and applying the shifted schedule 𝜎= 𝜙(𝑢, 𝑠) = 𝑠· 𝑢/ (1 + (𝑠−1) · 𝑢), where 𝑠is the shift
parameter. A Gaussian-weighted importance function 𝑤(𝜎) = exp −2 (𝜎−𝜎max/2) / 𝜎max
2, centered at the
midpoint of the schedule, concentrates training signal on intermediate noise levels where the denoising task is
most informative.
Training scale. Stage 1 trains for 500,000 steps on same-embodiment robot–robot pairs formed from 193,462
robot trajectories spanning 229 tasks. Stage 2 trains for 100,000 steps on human–robot pairs formed from an
additional 5,847 self-collected human video demonstrations, each paired with robot trajectories of the same
task drawn from that corpus. Hyperparameters are summarized in Supplementary Table 3.

Data Processing
Observations. Three RGB cameras observe the workspace, including one wrist-mounted camera on each
arm and one camera providing a static third-person view. Each camera captures 224×224 images, resized by
aligning dimensions to a multiple of 8 while preserving aspect ratio. Multi-view observations are vertically
concatenated in pixel space before VAE encoding, producing a combined frame of height 224 × 3 = 672 pixels.
The robot history length is 𝐾=0, meaning only the current frame is used and no historical frames are included.
Actions and proprioception. Each arm operates in a 10-dimensional action space, comprising a 3-dimensional
Cartesian position, a 6-dimensional rotation representation (108), and a 1-dimensional gripper aperture. To-
gether, the two arms form a 20-dimensional bimanual action space. The proprioceptive state is 20-dimensional,
encoding the end-effector pose of both arms. Actions are normalized per-dimension to [−1, 1] via linear min-
max scaling computed from training statistics. Six-dimensional rotation representations are used throughout
training and converted to Euler angles through the rotation matrix at inference time.
Temporal structure. Each video demonstration window W contains 𝐿=6×32=192 raw video demonstration
frames covering the coupled segment and its surrounding context. Temporal downsampling at an action-to-
video ratio of 8:1 produces the 192/8=24 video frames provided to the model. The mapping derived from
alignment and formulated in Eq. 7 establishes a monotonic correspondence at the frame level between video
demonstration frames and robot frames. The resulting target is defined at action resolution and contains 𝐻=32
aligned robot timesteps per cycle. All 𝐻actions are retained for action prediction, while the corresponding
observations are uniformly downsampled at an 8:1 ratio before video encoding, yielding 𝐻/8=4 target frames
for video prediction. During training, the video demonstration window position is randomly offset to vary
the surrounding context. The base action frame interval is 15 frames at 32 Hz, and it is randomly scaled by
a factor drawn uniformly from [0.5, 2.0] to improve robustness to execution speed variation. Static frames,
identified by rotation, translation, and gripper displacement thresholds of 0.001, are removed from trajectories
before sampling.
Data augmentation. Augmentation is applied per-sample with temporally consistent parameters across all
frames. Brightness, contrast, and saturation are each scaled by a factor drawn uniformly from [0.7, 1.3],
and hue is shifted uniformly in [−0.05, 0.05]. Gaussian blur, with 𝜎drawn from [0.1, 2.0], is applied with
probability 0.5. Random cropping with scale in [0.8, 1.0] is also applied. Hyperparameters are summarized in
Supplementary Table 4.

Inference
At each step, the three targets are generated through sequential autoregressive denoising (Eq. 17), using a
first-order Euler ODE solver. Localization is denoised in 10 steps from pure Gaussian noise, producing the clean
progress token ˆ𝑦𝑝that conditions subsequent stages. Visual prediction is then denoised in 20 steps, generating
the predicted future observations ˆ𝑦𝑜conditioned on ˆ𝑦𝑝. Finally, action is denoised in 20 steps, producing the
action chunk ˆ𝑦𝑎conditioned on both ˆ𝑦𝑝and ˆ𝑦𝑜. Each stage uses its respective scheduler configuration, with
shift =3.0 for localization and shift =5.0 for visual prediction and action. The inference schedule samples
uniform steps from 𝜎=1 to 𝜎=0 and transforms them through the same shifted schedule 𝜙used during training.
The predicted action chunk of 𝐻=32 steps is fully executed before the next step. The video demonstration
window W is advanced via Eq. 18 with the predicted localization scalar, and the window start is monotonically
clipped to [𝑤𝑡, |𝜏𝑑|−𝐿] to prevent backward drift. Hyperparameters are summarized in Supplementary Table 5.
